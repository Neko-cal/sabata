`stt-bm-quartznet15x5` is a fine-tuned version of NVIDIAâ€™s [`stt_fr_quartznet15x5`](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/nemo/models/stt_fr_quartznet15x5) optimized for **Bambara ASR**. This model cannot write **Punctuations and Capitalizations**, it utilizes a character encoding scheme, and transcribes text in the standard character set that is provided in the training set of bam-asr-all dataset.

The model was fine-tuned using **NVIDIA NeMo** and is trained with **CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification) Loss**.

## NVIDIA NeMo: Training

To fine-tune or use the model, install [NVIDIA NeMo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo). We recommend installing it after setting up the latest PyTorch version.

```bash
pip install nemo_toolkit['asr']
```

## How to Use This Model

### Load Model with NeMo
```python
import nemo.collections.asr as nemo_asr
asr_model = nemo_asr.models.EncDecCTCModel.from_pretrained(model_name="RobotsMali/stt-bm-quartznet15x5")
```

### Transcribe Audio
```python
# Assuming you have a test audio file named sample_audio.wav
asr_model.transcribe(['sample_audio.wav'])
```

### Input

This model accepts **16 kHz mono-channel audio (wav files)** as input.

### Output

This model provides transcribed speech as a string for a given speech sample.

## Model Architecture

QuartzNet is a convolutional architecture, which consists of **1D time-channel separable convolutions** optimized for speech recognition. More information on QuartzNet can be found here: [QuartzNet Model](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/nemotoolkit/asr/models.html#quartznet).

## Training

The NeMo toolkit was used to fine-tune this model for **25939 steps** over the `stt_fr_quartznet15x5` model. This model is trained with this [base config](https://github.com/diarray-hub/bambara-asr/blob/main/configs/quartznet-20m-config-v2.yaml). The full training configurations, scripts, and experimental logs are available here:

ðŸ”— [Bambara-ASR Experiments](https://github.com/diarray-hub/bambara-asr)

## Dataset
This model was fine-tuned on the [bam-asr-all](https://huggingface.co/datasets/RobotsMali/bam-asr-all) dataset, which consists of **37 hours of transcribed Bambara speech data**. The dataset is primarily derived from **Jeli-ASR dataset** (~87%).

## Performance

The performance of Automatic Speech Recognition models is measured using **Word Error Rate (WER%)**.

|**Version**|**Tokenizer**|**Vocabulary Size**|**bam-asr-all (test set)**|
|---------|-----------------------|-----------------|---------|
| V2  | Character-wise | 45            | 46.5         |

These are **greedy WER numbers without external LM**.
